# Release v1.1.2 (2025-12-09)

## Summary

This is a small feature and documentation release that adds explicit port support when building the Vault base URI and ships a complete English README with usage guidance and examples.

## Highlights

- Added: Honor `port` config / `VAULT_PORT` when constructing the Vault base URI (useful when host and port are provided separately in environment).
- Added: Full English `README.md` usage guide with examples (Controllers, DI, Jobs, Commands, Vault Agent, Token File usage).
- Changed: Documentation and packaging metadata improvements.

## Files changed

- `config/vault.php` — added `token_file` and `port` config keys.
- `src/VaultServiceProvider.php` — provider appends `:port` to base URI when `port` is set and address has no port.
- `README.md` — fully rewritten English usage guide.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — new entry for v1.1.2.

## Notes for users

- You can provide the Vault port either as part of `VAULT_ADDR` (e.g. `http://vault.example.com:8200`) or separately using `VAULT_PORT` (e.g. `VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.example.com` + `VAULT_PORT=8200`).
- For production, prefer using `VAULT_TOKEN_FILE` (Vault Agent sink) or other short-lived auth mechanisms.
